				Uncertainty Quantification for the Life Sciences (UQ4Life) is a Research Training Group (RTG) 
				based in NC State University led by my advisors, Brian Reich and Mette Olufsen. UQ4Life focuses 
				on interdisciplinary research between statistics, mathematics, and life sciences. Through this RTG 
				I've been able to work with people from various disciplines, allowing myself to work in research 
				outside of statistics and math. Most of the projects I've worked on have explicit Biological and 
				Ecological Applications. 
				<br>
				<br>
				Biological and Ecological research typically relies on differential equation models that are based 
				on theory developed in those respective fields, which are then calibrated with data. While there are 
				established methods for fitting these models to data, it is much trickier to quantify uncertainty 
				in these models. For example, the data could be noisy, be from different sources, or some variables
				may be unaccounted for. <b>My research is motivated by faithfully bringing statistical rigor and notions 
				of uncertainty to these applications, resulting in a deeper understanding of what the data says. 
				If scientists and researchers better understand the uncertainty of the model and data, then decisions 
				will be better informed, results from scientific experiments can be more clearly parsed, and future 
				models can aim to minimize uncertainty going forward.</b>
				<br>
				<br>
				My research includes a handful of main themes:
				<br>
				<br>
				<h2><i>Model Calibration and Uncertainty Quantification via Bayesian Computation</i></h2>
				Complex differential equation models are extensively used in life sciences to make predictions 
				on our health or environment under various conditions. I use Bayesian parameter inference to 
				calibrate these models with data to ensure they are realistic, producing accurate measurements 
				of uncertainty to provide reliable information for scientists and decision makers. 
				<br>
				<br>
				<h2><i>Physics-Informed Learning</i></h2>
				I also research AI and Machine Learning models, having coded many models to be fast and powerful 
				data-driven predictors. My research explores how to improve the predictive power of these models 
				by leveraging information from the Biological and Ecological models.
				<br>
				<br>
				<h2><i>Dimension-Reduction</i></h2>
				Because my work incorporates Bayesian methodologies with complex, mathematical models and data from different 
				sources, the problems are often high-dimensional and computationally expensive. Therefore, I tend 
				to also be interested in research involving dimension reduction and computational speedups. 
				<br>
				<br>
<!-- 				<h2><i>Surrogate Modeling</i></h2>
				In some situations, it is crucial to evaluate the differential equation models many times, but often these are 
				computationally expensive, taking hours to days for each evaluation. Surrogate modeling is when these differential 
				equation models are approximated by simpler, often statistical models. 
				<br>
				<br>
				<h2><i>Data Assimilation via Bayesian Recursive Estimation</i></h2>
				In many applications, such as weather forecasting or epidemiological studies, data is gathered over time. Here, we'd 
				like to calibrate models repeatedly over time. Bayesian methods have been proposed to specifically allow regular updates
				of our model parameters given streamed data. 
				<br>
				<br>
				<h2><i>Prior Elicitation</i></h2>
				Most of my research projects have been alongside leading experts in various fields. Prior Elicitation refers to improving 
				the accuracy of the fitted models by integrating expert opinion into the model calibration process. Sometimes this can be 
				done trivially, but sometimes the structure of the model makes this difficult. Thus, some research aims to develop techniques
				to more easily and faithfully allow this to be done.
				<br>
				<br> -->
				<h2><i>... More Coming Soon!</i></h2>
				I've only just begun my career in research. Most recently Iâ€™ve begun learning about functional data analysis and network 
				data to give myself flexibility in leveraging different data types to these Biological and Ecological applications. Looking 
				forward to announcing new projects and angles of research soon!
