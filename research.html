				Uncertainty Quantification for the Life Sciences (UQ4Life) is a Research Training Group (RTG) 
				based in NC State University led by my advisors, Brian J. Reich and Mette S. Olufsen. UQ4Life focuses 
				on interdisciplinary research between statistics, mathematics, and life sciences. Through this RTG 
				I've been able to work with people from various disciplines, allowing myself to work in research 
				outside of statistics and math. Most of the projects I've worked on are applications in epidemiology, 
				ecology, biology, and atmospheric science.
				<br>
				<br>
				Biological, ecological, and atmospheric science research typically relies on differential equation models 
				that are based on theory developed in those respective fields, which are then calibrated with data. While 
				there are established methods for fitting these models to data, it is much trickier to quantify uncertainty 
				in these models. For example, the data could be noisy, be from different sources, or some variables
				may be unaccounted for. 
				<br>
				<br>
				<b>My research has two primary motivations. First, bringing statistical rigor and notions 
				of uncertainty to these applications is crucial to have a deeper understanding of what the data says. 
				If scientists and researchers better understand the uncertainty of the model and data, then decisions 
				will be better informed, results from scientific experiments can be more clearly identified, and future 
				models can aim to minimize uncertainty going forward. On the other hand, evaluating these differential equation models 
				are often computationally expensive. Additionally, many procedures, such as optimization or system monitoring, 
				requires regular evaluation of these expensive operations. Therefore, a second motivation of my research is 
				developing scalable methods to performance this inference, allowing scientists to perform these expensive operations 
				much more frequently and quickly.

				<br>
				<br>
				My research encompasses a few areas:
				<br>
				<br>
				<h2><i>Simulation-based inference in differential equation models</i></h2>
				Differential equation models are extensively used in life sciences to make predictions 
				on our health or environment under various conditions. Bayesian inference calibrates 
				the parameters of these models with data to ensure they are realistic and produces accurate 
				measurements of uncertainty. However, complex differential equation models are computationally 
				infeasible for most traditional Bayesian approaches. Simulation-based inference is the subfield 
				of Bayesian computation that relies on repeatedly simulating data from different differential 
				equation models to identify which models and parameter values are realistic. 
				<br>
				<br>
				<h2><i>Amortized Inference</i></h2>
				In some situations, it is crucial to evaluate the differential equation models many times, such 
				as in optimization or when systems must be regularly monitored. Often differential equation models 
				are computationally expensive, taking hours to days for each evaluation, which is only exacerbated 
				when this needs to be repeated. Amortized inference is when a framework for the differential 
				equation, such as the differential equation itself, or a surrogate, is executed many times, and the 
				Bayesian inference is learned using data-driven models. Then, this inference can be repeated with 
				those computationally cheaper learned mappings.
				<br>
				<br>
				<h2><i>Physics-Informed Learning with Heterogeneous Data Sources</i></h2>
				Physics-informed learning is when physics is used to improve the predictive power of data-driven 
				models by leveraging information from the Biological, Physical, Chemical, or Ecological 
				differential equation models. Usually, this is done by adding a regularization term that ensures 
				solutions look more similar to solutions to differential equations, but my projects are more 
				focused on heterogeneous data sources, where a data-driven model is trained with two different 
				datasets—one of them from a differential equation model and another consists of observed data. 
				Bayesian-inspired approaches are used to train a data-driven model on observations while being 
				partially informed by those differential equation models. 
				<br>
				<br>
				<h2><i>Scalable High-Dimensional Inference</i></h2>
				Because my work incorporates Bayesian methodologies with complex, mathematical models and data 
				from different sources, the problems are often high-dimensional and computationally expensive. 
				Therefore, I tend to also be interested in research involving dimension reduction and computational 
				speedups.
				<br>
				<br>
				<h2><i>Statistical Shape Analysis</i></h2>
				Statistical shape analysis is an approach that uses statistical models to analyze the shape of a 
				sample of objects. The shape of objects is represented as a collection of coordinates in 2D or 3D 
				space after standardizing for size, orientation, and shift. Often these statistical shape models 
				project every object to a lower-dimensional subspace before performing inference, such as 
				prediction or effect estimation of a treatment.	
				<br>
				<br>
				<b>Although I haven't formally started research in these areas, I'm
				keen to start new projects involving these subjects:</b>
				<br>
				<br>
				<h2><i>Data Assimilation via Bayesian Recursive Estimation</i></h2>
				In weather forecasting, epidemiological problems, and various ecological studies, data is 
				gathered over time. Data assimilation refers to the process of combining forecast data from 
				a differential equation model with observations to update or fine-tune those forecasts. Data 
				assimilation methods can be thought of as state-space estimators such as Kalman filters. This 
				is usually implemented in a Bayesian framework, since prior beliefs can be defined as previous 
				forecasts, and a posterior state estimate can be regularly updated with newly observed data. 
				Sometimes this data is referred to as “streamed data”, and certain computational methods exist 
				that can more efficiently integrate them into our posterior updates.
				<br>
				<br>
				<h2><i>Prior Elicitation</i></h2>
				Most of my research projects have been alongside leading experts in various fields. Prior 
				Elicitation refers to improving the accuracy of the fitted models by integrating expert opinion 
				into the model calibration process. Sometimes this can be done trivially, but sometimes the 
				structure of the model and prior results makes this difficult. Thus, research can be done 
				develop techniques to more easily and faithfully allow this to be done.
