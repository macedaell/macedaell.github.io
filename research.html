				I have two primary research areas: (1) Bayesian parameter estimation and uncertainty 
				quantification in complex, intractable mathematical models using simulation-based inference 
				and variational inference. (2) Using data from those mathematical models to improve the 
				predictive power of machine learning models (Physics-Informed Learning). 
				<br>
				<br>
				My applications tend to be environmental or epidemiological, where mathematical models, such 
				as in numerical weather prediction, are crucial and the benefit to society is very clear. 
				My main motivation is rooted in methodology, so I’m open to working on a wide variety of 
				applications. 
				<br>
				<br>
				Because my work incorporates Bayesian methodologies with complex, mathematical models and data from different 
				sources, the problems are often high-dimensional and computationally expensive. Therefore, I tend 
				to also be interested in research involving dimension reduction and computational speedups. 
				<br>
				<br>
				Most recently I’ve begun learning about functional data analysis and network data to give myself 
				flexibility in modeling different data types. More news to come from these exciting new projects!
				<br>

				Please email me if you are interested in collaborating!
