				I have two primary research areas: (1) Bayesian parameter estimation and uncertainty 
				quantification in complex, intractable mathematical models using simulation-based inference 
				and variational inference. (2) Using data from those mathematical models to improve the 
				predictive power of machine learning models (Physics-Informed Learning). 
				<br>
				<br>
				My applications tend to be environmental or epidemiological, where mathematical models, such 
				as in numerical weather prediction, are crucial and the benefit to society is very clear. 
				My main motivation is rooted in methodology, so I’m open to working on a wide variety of 
				applications. 
				<br>
				<br>
				Because my work incorporates Bayesian methodologies with complex, mathematical models and data from different 
				sources, the problems are often high-dimensional and computationally expensive. Therefore, I tend 
				to also be interested in research involving dimension reduction and computational speedups. 
				<br>
				<br>
				Most recently I’ve begun learning about functional data analysis and network data to give myself 
				flexibility in modeling different data types. More news to come from these exciting new projects!
				<br>
				<br>
				I am a member of UQ4Life, a Research Training Group (RTG) focusing on interdisciplinary 
				research between statistics, mathematics, and life sciences. My background is in Statistics 
				and Mathematics, but most of my projects are rooted in Biology and Ecology.
				<br>
				<br>
				Complex differential equation models are extensively used in life sciences to make predictions 
				on our health or environment under various conditions. I use Bayesian parameter inference to 
				calibrate these models with data to ensure they are realistic, producing accurate measurements 
				of uncertainty to provide reliable information for scientists and decision makers. 
				<br>
				<br>
				I also research AI and Machine Learning models, having coded many models to be fast and powerful 
				data-driven predictors. My research explores how to improve the predictive power of these models 
				by leveraging information from the Biological and Ecological models.
