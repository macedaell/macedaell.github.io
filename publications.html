				My first foray into using simulation-based inference to estimate parameters 
					in the context of analytically intractable models. In this paper, my team and I 
					proposed VaNBayes, a neural posterior estimator that estimates hyperparameters 
					of the variational posterior instead of modeling the full posterior direction. 
					We believe that doing this could have some computational benefits. This paper 
					ended up being a very empirical/application-based paper, with many examples of 
					this approach working well. This was also my first paper ever, so it has a special 
					place in my heart. ðŸ˜Š

				4D-Var is a powerful approach used in Data Assimilation, but it is computationally expensive. 
					In this paper, we propose using statistical dimension reduction techniques and a new 
					framework where an emulator is built from chemical transportation model data. 
					The results are similar to 4D-Var, but estimates are far more computationally efficient 
					to obtain.

				In this project I served as the statistician among a team of mathematical biologists. In her thesis, 
					Dr. Megan Miller investigated the differences between hypertensive and non-hypertensive mice in 
					pulmonary arterial networks. In this follow-up paper, we investigate the effect that the shape of 
					these pulmonary arterial networks have on the blood flow. As the statistician on the team, I was 
					responsible for obtaining network statistics, statistical shape analysis, and conducting statistical 
					inference comparing the two mice groups.
